To run the Python script Part 2.py on a Linux system, you should consider the following aspects:

1.Environment Dependencies:

Ensure Python and required libraries such as pandas, nltk, sklearn, etc., are installed.
The script uses !pip install commands to install nltk and chardet. These commands should be executed manually in the command line before running the script, or you can ensure that these libraries are already installed.

2.File and Directory Paths:

The file path used in the script /BBC/{label} should be replaced with the actual path.
File Encoding Issues:

3.NLP Resources Download:

There's a command nltk.download('popular') in the script for downloading necessary NLP packages such as stopwords list, tokenizers, etc. Ensure that this step is successfully executed in your environment.
